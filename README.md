# README Generator

## Description
This is a program which will help generate a well detailed README.md for your project or at least create a skeleton upon which the user can add more detail to later on. The generated README.md will include: title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributions, tests, and questions. Currently there are only 4 options for licenses.

## Table of Contents
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [License](#license)
* [Contributing](#contributing)
* [Tests](#tests)
